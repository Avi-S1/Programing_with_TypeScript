Like any other langage(s), you might have known, Typescript can be used for for general programing (like mathematical calculation, printing texts or patterns, etc.). But mostly it is used in the field of web-development. \

## _Few things about TypeScript(TS) Language_
<ul>
  <li>In simple words, you can say, <code>Typescript(TS)</code> is an open-source programming language developed by <code>Microsoft</code> that compiles to <code>JavaScript</code>. </li> <li> It is released in 2012, and has remained in active development and continues to gain in popularity every year. In 2019, TypeScript(TS) was the 7th most-used and the 5rd fastest-growing language on GitHub, with over 5 million weekly downloads of its compiler.</li> <br/> As TS is very similar to Javascript(JS), but there are some noticable differences. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript doesnâ€™t alter JavaScript, instead expanding it with new, valuable features. Everything that can be written in JavaScript can also be written in TypeScript.
